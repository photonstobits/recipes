Spicy Ahi (Ahi = Tuna):
1)      Tuna flank sliced into small cubes or as small as you like
2)      Diced sweet onion (Maui sweet onions if you can find it, regular 
onions might be harsh unless you fry them a bit)
3)      Diced green onions
4)      Mayonnaise (this is the sauce but only add as much as you are 
comfortable consuming)
5)      Sriracha sauce (ratio of 2:1 to mayo or add more for more spice)
6)      Sesame seed oil (add to flavor and usually it is a little more than 
you expect but not at much as the Sriracha)
 
Ahi Shoyu (Shoyu = Soy Sauce)
1)      Tuna flank sliced into cubes (usually larger and intended to be more 
visual than the spicy Ahi pieces, since the spicy Ahi has a sauce covering them)
2)      Sliced sweet onion (this one really needs the sweet onions since the 
sauce is not masking these larger slices)
3)      Diced green onion
4)      Shoyu (again, only add as much soy sauce as you are comfortable 
consuming but this is intended as the base marinade) 
5)      Sesame seeds
6)      Sesame seed oil (again, add to flavor)
